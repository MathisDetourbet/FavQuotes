My Fav Quotes
The goal of the test is to develop “My Fav Quotes” app, an app that lets you display your favorite quotes from ​https://favqs.com/​.
First, create an account on the website, and add a few favorite quotes to your account.
Then, create an empty project, initialize a git repository in it and create a ./README.md file. Make as many commits as you want. Each commit closing the Step must be “tagged” with “STEP X” where X is the Step number. Push your work in a remote git repository and send us the access link :)
1/ Use FavQs REST API to prompt user to connect to his account and retrieve his info (nickname, picture and count of fav quotes).
2/ List the user’s favorites quotes. Display all the information available for a quote. 3/ Make the list of favorite quotes available offline.
Bonus points:
● clear and simple UI/UX (you can use multiple screens)
● a few tests
Remarks :
● https://favqs.com/api
● You can use as many external libraries as you want
● Use UIKit (it’s nice if you know SwiftUI, but the project is using UIKit)
● Any architecture is okay, but you must be able to justify why you chose it over another one.
